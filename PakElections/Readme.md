# Pakistan Elections Analysis
***

This repository contains code and data files used for the project of scraping data of elections conducted in Pakistan in 2013. Data was scraped and analyzed to provide recommendations for the then incumbant party in parliament PMLN (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) and for the then favorites PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf). An article discussing the analysis can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pti-really-force-reckon-syed-fazeel-ahmed/).

Following is a brief description of the files:
